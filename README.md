This project involves developing a phishing site detection website using AWS services such as RDS for database management and EC2 for deployment. Due to the expiration of my trial period, I am unable to provide a live link to the website; however, I can share the source code of the project in a GitHub repository.The project consists of two main modules. The first is the Client User Module, which includes user login , user registration and provides the capability to predict whether a given website is a phishing site. The second is the Admin Module, which allows an admin to log in and view the entire usage history of the website. These modules work together to provide an effective solution for phishing site detection.
